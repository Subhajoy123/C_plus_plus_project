# Description 
In this project I have made the tic-tac-toe game using C + + language. I compiled it in Dev C + +.

It is a very popular game in which a person wins when he makes the three adjacent boxes similar horizontally, vertically or diagonally by crosses or circles. 

For making the particular rows and columns I used the symbolic characters within double quotation. For symbolising each box I used the concept of array index and switch
case.Inside a do-while loop I took the turns from the players. Then by using functions I initialised the particular Boxers. I used if statement and for loop
for the checking of adjacent boxes. Whenever the overall conditions become true to the player wins and if none
of the conditions are fulfilled then it is a draw.
